# Feedback-Platform
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to submit anonymous feedback and explore what others have shared. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, the project demonstrates how forms collect and handle user input while enabling community interaction through voting.
## Features
#### Submit Feedback: Users enter their name, email, and a feedback message. After submission, a thank-you message confirms receipt.
#### View Feedback: A separate page displays anonymous feedback from others, along with upvote/downvote buttons to show agreement or disagreement.
#### Vote Tracking: Each feedback item shows how many users agree or disagree, helping surface the most relevant or popular opinions.
## Tech Stack
#### Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
#### Backend: Node.js + Express
#### Database: PostgreSQL
## Learning Goals
#### Understand form handling and controlled components in React
#### Practice styling with Tailwind CSS
#### Build RESTful APIs with Express
